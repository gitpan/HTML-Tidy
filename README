HTML::Tidy
==========

HTML::Tidy is an HTML checker in a handy dandy object.  It's meant as
a replacement for HTML::Lint.

INSTALLATION

You need libtidy to build HTML::Tidy. Check section INSTALLING TIDY on this
document for more information.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

INSTALLING TIDY

You can get a distribution for libtidy at:

    http://tidy.sourceforge.net/src/tidy_src.tgz

You can also check out from the CVS tree with the following two steps:

Login in to the anonymous CVS server at SourceForge:

    $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/tidy login
    (Logging in to anonymous@cvs.sf.net)
    CVS password: [hit ENTER]

Check out the source tree:

    $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/tidy co tidy
    cvs server: Updating tidy
    cvs server: Updating tidy/CVSROOT
    U tidy/CVSROOT/checkoutlist
    U tidy/CVSROOT/commitinfo
    ... many many files come out ...


OS-SPECIFIC NOTES

If you're on Debian, you can install the libtidy-dev package.

If you're on Mac OS X and you've got Fink, you can install the
tidy-dev package (you must use the *source* package; the binary one
is too old). Otherwise, you'll need to tell the Makefile that you
use ranlib:

    $ export set RANLIB=ranlib

Change to the directory with the Makefile in it, and run make.
This example uses the GNU make Makefile.

    $ cd tidy/build/gmake/

    $ make
    if [ ! -d ./obj ]; then mkdir ./obj; fi
    gcc -o obj/access.o ...
    ... etc etc etc ...

Install the libs, headers and the tidy executable:

    $ sudo make install

If you're on Mac OS X, you'll have to run ranlib again on the
installed lib:

    $ sudo ranlib /usr/local/lib/libtidy.a

Once these steps are complete, you'll be able to go back to HTML::Tidy
and build it normally.
