Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Tidy.

1.02    Wed Mar  3 22:43:57 CST 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Added clean() method for cleaning up using the Tidy magic.
          Thanks to Ben Trott.

1.01_01 Sun Feb 29 11:39:07 CST 2004
        [FIXES]
        * Message parsing is split on a Ctrl-J instead of \n now.
          This should fix the test problems on Win32.

        * Removed the #include "ppport.h" from Tidy.xs so it can compile
          on Win32.  Thanks to crazyinsomniac.

        [MISCELLANEOUS]
        * Moved the install directions for tidylib into the README.

        First real version, released on an unsuspecting world.

        If you were one of the ones to get in on 0.01 thru 0.04, you may
        want to check your code.  The API has changed some.  I know that
        parse_file() is now parse(), for example.  There may be others.

        Going forward, of course, I'll note any other API changes here.
