0.00_01 Mon Feb 16 21:21:31 2004
        Very first version, wrapping the tidy lib from sourceforge.
        I don't expect that anyone will actually use this version,
        besides me.

        HTML::Tidy is to be a replacement for HTML::Lint.  It won't
        quite be a drop-in replacement, but closed.
