Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Tidy.

1.00    Wed Feb 25 22:19:28 CST 2004

        First real version, released on an unsuspecting world.

        If you were one of the ones to get in on 0.01 thru 0.04, you may
        want to check your code.  The API has changed some.  I know that
        parse_file() is now parse(), for example.  There may be others.

        Going forward, of course, I'll note any other API changes here.
