====================================
[ENHANCEMENTS]
webtidy's version statement now shows the version number of the underlying
tidyp library.

[FIXES]

utf8 was never encoded correctly.  Thanks, Vladimir Timofeev and Alistair
Francis.

The ->parse() method would sometimes return false even though everything
worked fine.  Thanks, @sebaer.

====================================
Please note that the bug tracker for HTML::Tidy is now at
http://github.com/petdance/html-tidy.

[FIXES]
Fixed incorrect calls to croak().  Thanks, Steve Grazzini.

[DOCUMENTATION]
Updating all docs referring to libtidyp and Alien::Libtidyp.


1.52    Wed May 12 2010
=======================
First release since the major overhaul that relies on libtidyp.

Now relies on Perl 5.8.  I'm not at all interested in supporting
ancient Perl version.

HTML::Tidy now relies on the libtidyp that Andy Lester maintains
on github.

[ENHANCEMENTS]
Now includes support for TIDY_INFO messages.

Improve support for Windows platforms.

[FIXES]
Fixed a segfault if there are no errors.

Allow for either "tidyp" or "HTML Tidy" as a program name in tests.
