Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Tidy.

1.52    Wed May 12 23:40:09 CDT 2010
------------------------------------
Now relies on Perl 5.8.  I'm not at all interested in supporting
ancient Perl versions.

HTML::Tidy now relies on the libtidyp that Andy Lester maintains
on github.

[ENHANCEMENTS]
Now includes support for TIDY_INFO messages.

Improve support for Windows platforms.

[FIXES]
Fixed a segfault if there are no errors.

Allow for either "tidyp" or "HTML Tidy" as a program name in tests.
